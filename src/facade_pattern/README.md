# The Facade Pattern
In this case, we'll use the facade pattern to simplify the process of movie watching.
The facade pattern is a structural design pattern that provides a simplified interface to a library,
a framework, or any other complex set of classes. The facade pattern is typically used when a system
is very complex or difficult to understand because the system has a large number of interdependent
classes or its source code is unavailable. The facade pattern hides the complexities of the larger
system and provides a simpler interface to the client. It typically involves a single wrapper class
that contains a set of members required by the client. These members access the system on behalf of
the facade client and hide the implementation details.

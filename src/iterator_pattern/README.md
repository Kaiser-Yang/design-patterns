# The Iterator Pattern
The iterator pattern is a design pattern in which an iterator is used to traverse a container and access the container's elements. The iterator pattern decouples algorithms from containers; in some cases, algorithms are necessarily container-specific and thus cannot be decoupled. The iterators are the interface between users and containers, and they are responsible for the traversal of the container.

The class diagram is shown below:
